# social-network

Sure, there are tons of social networks out there! Sure, they have tons of functionality... and can store images... and are overall very easy on the eyes... but we should be taking it back to simplier times! That's where our social network backend comes in; we have the basics, you, the user, your friends, your thoughts, and reactions! Don't worry, you can still edit and remove comments and friends if things change. And honestly, we'll probably add more features that you've already come to love.

This project challenged my knowledge of MongoDB, my logic balancing databases, and, as always, my attention to detail, especially when it comes to those semicolons. One of my greatest challenges was understanding the purpose of routes and controllers, and that while they can be fused into one file, they are both there to help direct data flow. Once I understood this, I had a new found appreciation for them both. After working with both MySQL and MongoDB, my understanding of the flow between database models has greatly deepened.
